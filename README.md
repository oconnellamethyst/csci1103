Assignments for University of Minnesota's Intro to Java.

I'm self studying this course in the hopes of getting a position in the Computer Science department as an instructors assistant (and maybe finally understand the FireBears robot code enough to code my own robots to take over the world! Mwahahahahahahahaha!). I have completed up to Week 1

This course uses the OER [Introduction to Programming Using Java](http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/index.html). I am also using the [course materials written by Professor Chris Kauffman](http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kauffman/1103/). This folder contains exerpts from this material, as well as my own original code. Please do not plagiarize, but feel free to learn from my code.
